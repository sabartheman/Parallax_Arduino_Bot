This uses a SSD1306 OLED display.  The libraries uses are provided by the benevolent Ladyada which have their own github pages. 
Most of the code implemented is modeled after the example code that Ladyada provides with her libraries.  
The arduino uses the QTI sensors that parallax provides with their arduino bot kits.  This code does not follow a line at this time.
